# Weather Data Classification Project

## Overview
Building classifiers to predict the "RainTomorrow" attribute in a weather dataset using KNIME. The project includes data preprocessing, building multiple classifiers, parameter tuning, and selecting the best model.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and transformation.
- Building and optimizing classifiers using KNIME.
- Parameter tuning and model evaluation.
- Submission of predictions to Kaggle for final assessment.

## Setup and Running the Workflow
1. Download the KNIME Analytics Platform from [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/downloads).
2. Import the workflow file into KNIME:
   - Open KNIME.
   - Go to **File** > **Import KNIME Workflow...**.
   - Select the exported workflow file and follow the prompts to import it.
3. Run the workflow to preprocess data, build classifiers, and make predictions.
